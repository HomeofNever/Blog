# Draft

Here I would like to keep some random stuff for future blog/note.

I can't really find something good to use for now: I mean, notion these things loosk nice but maybe a little over kill for me.  
I am looking for an alternative way to record what I have done bit by bit, and turn it into a blog possible in the future. 

## Motivation

I sometimes look back to my blog for some command or ideas I had before. I don't really have a good way organizating them and I found for now, the most effective way is to keep a document and adding everything I found during my progress. 

I think it is a good start to keep it with my blog here, as they could possibly be the next blog here.
